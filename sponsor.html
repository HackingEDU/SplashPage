  <h1> Overview </h1>

<p class="text-left">Many people are frustrated with our current education system, and HackingEDU is empowering students to step 

up and make a difference. This fall, over 1000 hackers will battle for 36 hours to create revolutionary products 

that will redefine the education system. We are providing the launchpad for students to invent the future of 

education and reinstate a new code for education practices.</p>

<br>

  <h1> Why We Are Different </h1>

<p class="text-left">HackingEDU was brought to life when a group of 11 Google Student Ambassadors were asked to hold small

events at each of their respective universities, but instead, they dreamed of something much bigger. We are 

bringing together students from all across the west coast and inspiring them to change the world. At most 

hackathons, students have trouble coming up with meaningful ideas. At HackingEDU, students come because 

they want to revolutionize education. This massive collaboration of ideas and implementation will bring about 

change to the education system as a whole. 

<br>

<br>
Our team has a proven track record, having coordinated other hackathons such as Citrus Hack, HackSC, Davis 

Hacks, and Cal Hacks. ​We have a dedicated core team that spans over 11 universities and more than 20 ​other key 

members, so you can be confident that the hackathon will run smoothly and solidify its place as one of the most 

elite hackathons in the nation.</p>
